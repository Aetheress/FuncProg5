# FuncProg5
Repository for the fifth and final assignment of the Functional Programming course. Task pertains to the creation of decryption and encryption functions for a rail fence cypher in Clojure.

DISCLAIMER: Decryption function hasn't been created yet. Also regardless of the fact that the encryption function HAS been created, after its creation I realized that I forgot what I was implementing in the first place. The cipher doesn't work correctly as it works in the sequence of, for example, 1-2-3-1-2-3 instead of 1-2-3-2-1. As a result, this entire function must be redone, however, I had planned my work accordingly, KNOWING that I had one day left to make the other function, however, now I've been awakened to the cruel realization that I have to redo absolutely everything.

I will adjust the program for as long as it won't have been evaluated (since the deadline is January 1st, but it probably won't be evaluated ON January 1st), however, I definitely won't be able to redo this entire thing in less than twelve hours, because I need to deal with the stress that comes with the realization that I need to redo everything from scratch first. My head hurts.

Update: failure.clj contains the previous, unfinished attempt. newattempt.clj - I'm sure you can guess.
