# FuncProg5
Repository for the fifth and final assignment of the Functional Programming course. Task pertains to the creation of decryption and encryption functions for a rail fence cipher in Clojure. 

I will adjust the code for as long as it won't have been evaluated (since the deadline is January 1st, but it probably won't be evaluated ON January 1st). The program still has bugs, I'm currently working on fixing one in the encryption function. For the time being, as far as I know, the decryption function is correct, however, I'm going to test it more intensively once I get the encryption function back in order again (as I had thought it already was in order until now).

However, I've made enough progress to believe that if this assignment is being evaluated before I've polished it, then you shouldn't think "I'll come back later", I already did most of this after the deadline so feel free to evaluate what there is to be evaluated when the time comes.
