# FuncProg5
Repository for the fifth and final assignment of the Functional Programming course. Task pertains to the creation of decryption and encryption functions for a rail fence cypher in Clojure.

DISCLAIMER: Decryption function hasn't been created yet. Still trying to figure out the algorithm for decryption, haven't begun coding yet.

I will adjust the code for as long as it won't have been evaluated (since the deadline is January 1st, but it probably won't be evaluated ON January 1st).
