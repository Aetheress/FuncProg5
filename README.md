# FuncProg5
Repository for the fifth and final assignment of the Functional Programming course. Task pertains to the creation of decryption and encryption functions for a rail fence cypher in Clojure.

DISCLAIMER: Decryption function hasn't been created yet. I've more or less figured out what kind of algorithm to use with a few kinks still left to figure out. Either way some of the components that will be used in decryption have been created, although the rail length calculations aren't completely correct just yet as they don't cooperate in certaion scenarios. I intend to fix this, of course, but later.

I will adjust the code for as long as it won't have been evaluated (since the deadline is January 1st, but it probably won't be evaluated ON January 1st).
